# TypeScript Patterns

## React Component Structure

- Use `FC<Props>` type for functional components
- Define props interfaces above component definitions
- Use `useCallback` for event handlers and complex functions
- Prefer `const` over `let` when variables aren't reassigned

## Type Safety

- Cast unknown types carefully: `as unknown as SpecificType`
- Use type guards for runtime validation
- Define proper interfaces for complex objects
- Avoid `any` types - use `unknown` instead

## Error Handling

- Use try-catch for async operations and API calls
- Provide descriptive error messages with context
- Log unexpected results for debugging: `console.error("Unexpected result:", result)`
